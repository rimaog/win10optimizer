How to Remove PowerShell Execution Policy Restrictions

By default, Windows restricts running PowerShell scripts for security purposes. If you're running into issues, you'll need to adjust the execution policy. Follow these steps:

    Open PowerShell as Administrator.
    Type the following command and press Enter:

    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

    Type Y (for Yes) to confirm.

This will allow you to run scripts that you’ve downloaded from the internet as long as they are signed.
